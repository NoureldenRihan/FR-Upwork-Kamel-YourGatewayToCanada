              <span>1/</span>Smartphone and Power Bank: A smartphone is
              essential for communication, navigation, and accessing important
              information. With a good battery and power bank, you'll avoid
              running out of power during travel or while waiting at the
              airport, which could disrupt communication or access to necessary
              documents.

          <li class="travelKitItem">
            <p>
              <span>2/</span>Laptop Computer: This helps you handle digital
              documentation, stay connected with family, manage finances, or
              even work remotely if needed. It also supports job searches,
              accommodation bookings, and online communication with Canadian
              authorities.
            </p>

              <span>3/</span>tock of Medications: You may not immediately have
              access to medical care in Canada, and some medications might
              require prescriptions or take time to obtain. It’s crucial to
              bring both adult and child medications, especially for chronic
              conditions.

          <li class="travelKitItem">
            <p>
              <span>4/</span>Dental and Medical Consultations: Dental care can
              be expensive and may not be covered by insurance upon arrival.
              Addressing dental and health concerns before leaving ensures
              you’re in good health and avoid emergencies when you first arrive.

              <span>5/</span>Diapers for Babies: Baby essentials like diapers
              may not be easily available or affordable immediately after
              arrival, especially if you are unfamiliar with local stores.
              Bringing enough ensures you’re covered for the first few days.

          <li class="travelKitItem">
            <p>
              <span>6/</span>Winter Jackets: While Canada is known for its harsh
              winters, buying jackets there ensures you get clothing suitable
              for the specific climate. One jacket per person is sufficient for
              the journey; you can find more suitable gear in Canada.
            </p>

          <li class="travelKitItem">
            <p>
              <span>7/</span>Medical Records: These are critical, especially for
              chronic conditions, to inform healthcare providers in Canada about
              your medical history and treatments.

          <li class="travelKitItem">
            <p>
              <span>8/</span>IRCC Documents: All immigration-related documents
              are necessary to prove your legal status and for future use during
              settlement. Having both digital and physical copies ensures you
              have access in case of emergencies.

          <li class="travelKitItem">
            <p>
              <span>9/</span>Passport Photos: These photos are often required
              for documents like health cards, Social Insurance Numbers (SIN),
              or other ID requirements in Canada, and getting them in advance
              can save time.

              <span>10/</span>Electronic Device Advice: Hair dryers and irons
              from home may not work properly due to voltage differences, so
              it's better to buy them in Canada. For other electronics, you can
              bring a universal adapter.

              <span>11/</span>Baby Milk and Hot Liquids: Rules for carrying
              liquids vary across airlines. Checking in advance avoids
              complications at security checkpoints, ensuring you have what your
              baby needs during the flight.
